"""N-PORT enum code → json output schema string lookups.

Codes are per the SEC N-PORT XML technical spec. Verified against
live filings for VTI (equity) and BND (bond) and against the lookups
edgartools' own derivative-classification code uses.

Also hosts the SIC → coarse sector lookup used by the securities
registry. SIC mapping data lives in `config/sic_to_sector.json` so
it stays diffable / PR-reviewable rather than buried in code.
